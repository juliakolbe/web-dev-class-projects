         which is witty and youthful. "-->
        <p class="justified-text"> Oscar Wilde wasn’t just a writer—he was a legend draped in velvet 
            and wit sharper than a well-cut cravat. Known for his dazzling plays 
            like <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> and his beautifully tragic novel 
            <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, Wilde mastered the art of blending humor 
            with biting social critique.
            
            <br></br>
            
            A true icon of individuality, he lived by 
            his own rules, turning everyday life into a stage for brilliance and 
            rebellion. Whether you love him for his genius one-liners 
            ("Be yourself; everyone else is already taken") or
             his unapologetic flair, one thing’s for sure -— Oscar Wilde was, 
             and still is, <b>the King of Clever.</b></p>

    <p class="justified-text"> During the late 19th century, Wilde's collection of essays entitled <i>"Intentions"</i> wherein Wilde 
    discusses that life imitates Art far more than Art imitates life.</p>
    <p>
        <pre>
        <blockquote class="quote">
        "Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life. 
        
        It is Art that makes us aware of our own petty emotions, and teaches us 
        how to see things. The great achievements of the imagination always precede 
        and determine the achievements of the reality. 
        The final revelation is that Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, 
        is the proper aim of Art."

<h6> A bit more about my favorite play of Wilde's, <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i></h6>
<p class="justified">
    Wilde cleverly names his main character Earnest Worthing to poke fun at the very meaning of the name 
    <code>"earnestness"</code> which is the quality of honesty and sincerity. However, 
    most of the play's tension stems from the fact that Earnest has lied about who he truly is.
